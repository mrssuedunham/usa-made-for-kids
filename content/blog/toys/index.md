## Wood Toys

### [Bannor Toys](https://bannortoys.com/)

Made in Iowa, USA with organic paints and finishes. Crafted from responsibly harvested American hardwoods.

> Jesse and I started Bannor Toys back in 2011 with the idea that the wooden toys we found in our grandparents houses should be made modern to allow our children's imagination and creativity to develop in a way the battery operated toys of today don't, with the idea that play should be fun + easy, and the idea that if kids are learning while they play it is a win-win for everyone!
