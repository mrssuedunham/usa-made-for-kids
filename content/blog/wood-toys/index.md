## Bannor Toys

Madrid, IA

Made in Iowa, USA with organic paints and finishes. Crafted from responsibly harvested American hardwoods.

> Jesse and I started [Bannor Toys](https://bannortoys.com) back in 2011 with the idea that the wooden toys we found in our grandparents houses should be made modern to allow our children's imagination and creativity to develop in a way the battery operated toys of today don't, with the idea that play should be fun + easy, and the idea that if kids are learning while they play it is a win-win for everyone!

## Milton and Gooses

Lancaster County, PA

> [Milton and Goose](https://miltonandgoose.com/) was founded in 2017 to provide children and their parents with nontoxic and heirloom-quality toys to last generations. They say "Necessity is the mother of invention," so who better to invent than a mother in search of a solution? [Milton and Goose](https://miltonandgoose.com/)’s founder, Shari Raymond, was hunting for a play kitchen for her children and couldn’t find anything that met three reasonable requirements: made in the USA, high-quality wood, and a chic, modern design, so she set out to create her own.

## Roy Toy Wood Log Toy Building Sets

East Machias, ME

> On a warm August day in 1930, a horse-drawn wagon raced across a dusty Maine road and delivered our grandfather's log building sets to the train station across town. The first shipment of original [Roy Toy](https://www.roytoy.com/) wooden toys left Machias and a family heritage began.
> 
> Since that day, the world has changed greatly. As a [Roy Toy](https://www.roytoy.com/) customer, you are guaranteed that some things will never change. All of our pieces will continue to be made from wood, the quality of our products will remain unmatched, and our products will continue to be made right here in the U.S.A.
>
> All of our toys are crafted from materials of 100% USA origins and colored with food-grade dyes. Our wood is Eastern White Pine, sustainably-harvested in Maine. We lightly emboss the surfaces of each wooden block for a smooth finish that is comfortable for little hands.

## Wild Apples

Trumansburg, NY

> From Berlin, Germany, I immigrated to the U.S. as a professor of German Literature. Currently I live with my family on 50 acres in Trumansburg, on the west side of Cayuga Lake in Central New York. Here I raise sheep, bees and utilize the trees which grow on my land.
>
> My designs are known in both the Old and New World. They are in the permanent collection of the Toy Museum in Nuremberg, Germany and the Hartsville Museum in Hartsville, NY. They have also been displayed in the "Toys for all Ages" show at the Smithsonian, and most recently in Paul J. Smith's "Objects for Use/Handmade by Design" show at the American Craft Museum in New York City. My designs have been published in Fine Woodworking Design Books, and The Woodworker's Journal and in the book, "Objects for Use" published in conjunction with the exhibition at the American Craft Museum in 2001. My work is found in craft stores and galleries throughout the United States and abroad.
